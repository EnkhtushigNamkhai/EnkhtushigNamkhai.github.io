            <p>Completed the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/">Udemy
                    course on Kubernetes and Docker by Stephen Grider</a> which allowed us to create a fibonocci
                calculator that was overly architectured on purpose to get familiar with different tools and different
                use cases.
                We first created the application using React for the UI and NodeJS for the BE services. We then created
                Dockerfiles for each of the components to containerize them and upload them to DockerHub.
                Once on Dockerhub, we used TravisCI to help grab the images and deploy them onto our Google Cloud
                Project and onto GKE.</p> <a href="https://github.com/EnkhtushigNamkhai/multi-k8s">See on Github</a>

            <h3 class="projectTitle">Amazon Architecture Visualization</h3>
            <div>
                <p><i><b>Tools/Tech stack used:</b> Node/Express, Axios, Postgres, Artillery, Faker.js, New Relic</i>
                </p>

                <p>The app that we made was an Amazon clone. To determine if at the time of prime trial sign up, if
                    users that spend above 100$ are more likely to stay as a prime member versus those that don‚Äôt, we
                    thought about the types of services that Amazon might actually have.</p>

                <p>The service that I worked on was Transactions:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Receives user transactions from the client service, and stores the incoming transactions before
                        sending them off to another service that completes the charging of the user and paying of the
                        vendors. Once the transaction is complete, It updates the transaction status to completed if it
                        was a successful transaction, and failed, if the transaction failed for some reason (i.e.
                        account did not have enough funds).
                    </li>
                    <li>Tells inventory to update</li>
                    <li>Also sends to the Users service, if a user subscribed or unsubscribed from the free trial.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I used postgres to store the Transactions, because I needed the ACID properties of a relational
                    database since Data integrity was critical in my service
                    I started running artillery with a constant duration of 10s and slowly increased the arrival rate
                    from 10, to 100 and then to 1000, (all completed with no errors, but latency was bad)</p>

                <p><i>My starting RPS was about 190 but I was able to make it vary from 300-400 RPS with my
                        optimizations.</i></p>

                <p>LoadTesting setup: I ran Artillery with the duration of 10s with 1000RPS (in total 10,000 Request are
                    made)

                    <img src="/assets/ArtilleryYMLFile.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>My optimizations:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>First optimization:</b> Batch inserting the multiple products for a single transaction into
                        the PurchasedProducts which got me to about 195 RPS. There wasn‚Äôt a significant increase because
                        for my load test, I only had a max of 5 products per transaction. So to actually see how
                        effective the batch insert was, I ran a different test, where I increased the number of products
                        to 100 and measured the RPS and saw that without batch inserting, it processed 18RPS but with
                        batch inserting it processed 170RPS.</li>

                    <li><b>Second optimization:</b> Adding node clusters.
                        By adding more workers, I was able to get to about 214RPS.</li>

                    <li><b>Third optimization:</b> From new relic, I was able to see that my insert into the
                        userTransaction table was taking up the most time and that was because userTransaction had a lot
                        of columns with type text and the table was just overloaded with data.
                        So, I decided to separate it out into two smaller tables and used varchar instead.
                        I expected that the updates from pending status to Completed/Failed would be faster, because the
                        table was now so much smaller.
                        This optimization made my RPS to about 270. </li>
                </ol>

                As I increased the arrival rate for Artillery from a 1,000RPS to 10,000RPS, I noticed that my average
                RPS varied from 300 - 400RPS. So I was able to increase the RPS by almost <b>double</b> the amount with
                these optimizations!

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is an MVP for an idea I came up with.</li>
                <li>The intent of this App is to quickly send a message to a group of people that you save beforehand.
                    The idea is that you don't have to explain why you are contacting everyone. You will only contact
                    your loved ones from this app if you are in danger and you need immediate help, and speaking on the
                    phone/searching for people in your contacts to send the message to is not an option!
                </li>
                <li>The app will in the future iteration, have an option for you to save your login so that you won't
                    have to login everytime.
                    It will also be able to get your current location and allow you to send it along too.
                    In case one of your loved onces might be away from their phone at a critical time, you have the
                    option to send it to as many people as you want, to increase your chance of getting immediate help.
                </li>

                <li>Implemented authentication using Firebase. For the sending of text messages, used Twilio's SMS API.
                    Stored each user's saved numbers in a NoSQL Mongo Database for simplicity (since it's an MVP for
                    now).</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Implemented a comparison saving feature, to provide more control of the data to the user, using
                    React with Redux for the frontend, to keep the state of the app centralized, and a Node/express
                    server with a Mongo database for the backend </li>

                <li>Added and edited the front end structure of the overall app to effectively isolate each component so

            <p><i><b>Stack used:</b> Jquery, Javascript, CSS/HTML</i></p>
            <p>
                A simple TicTacToe game I made from scratch as a side project.
                For this project, I started off with implementing a TicTacToe game for 2 users, which meant that a
                single player could not play my game. :( So, in order to allow more people to play my TicTacToe game and
                expand the number of my end users, I thought that it would be a great idea, if I could implement a
                computer that could play against the player. Which I think is more interesting to talk about, so I am
                going to talk about what I did to implement the auto player logic bellow.</p>

            <p>I first decided to start off easy. The computer will chose a random move from the available moves on the
                board. Which was super easy to implement by just using the Math.random function in javascript.</p>

            <p>Then, as I was playing the game with my new computer opponent, I was bothered by the fact that the
                computer was just making random moves and it didn't have any reasoning or logic behind it. Therefore, I
                explored more about the minmax algorithm, and decided to actually implement it myself to create my
                TicTacToe opponent. After a few minutes surfing the web, I was able to come up with a minmax algorithm
                that either beat me or at the worst case tied with me.
                <b>The idea behind minmax:</b> An algorithm that generates the whole game tree and tries to maximize
                it's win. Each end state gets a score, which is a greater number if the maximizing player wins and
                negative if the opponent wins and 0 if they are tied. The maximizing opponent was the computer, and the
                minimizing opponent was the player. So everytime the player made a move, the computer generated all the
                possible outcomes and made the move that had the max score.
            <ul>This blog takes you step by step to implement the MinMax algorithm:
                <li><a
                        href="https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/2013/12/13/tic-tac-toe-understanding-the-minimax-algorithm13/">Understanding
                        MinMax Algorithm Blog</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Wikipedia Intro to MinMax</a></li>
            </ul>


            <p>So by this time, I was very satisfied with my TicTacToe game, however, I was once again bothered by the
                fact that a user can only tie with the computer player at best. I wanted the user to win sometimes too,
                so I decided to create a computer that had some randomness to it, but also had some logic, so that it
                wasn't completely useless.
                Out of all the different skill levels, I found the medium logic to be a bit challenging because I didn't
                want to make it too smart. At the end, I decided to just block a user's move whenever there were 2
                consecutive moves diagonally. And if the computer already has two marks in the rows, columns and
                diagonals, then it will make the move so that it can win.</p>
