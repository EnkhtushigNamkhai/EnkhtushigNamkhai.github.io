						<h1>My Travels at Japan</h1>
						<p>During the Summer of 2015, I decided to study abroad in Japan in order to fulfill my international studies requirement. I studied under the UCEAP program at Osaka University and took an intensive 8 unit Beginning Japanese language course. The whole journey was such a great experience for me. This trip was my first trip going to a different country by myself. I think this experience made me into a more well rounded person, and I made so many international friends!!</p>

							<h2>The end of my Journey</h2>
							<p>I think this picture represents the end of my journey really well! I had almost no idea what the characters meant, but I kept exploring and moving on with my friends, and I think that is what made it so fun! I think going to Japan revived my will to continue living life to the fullest!!! I really miss Japan!</p>
