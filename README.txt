Big Picture by HTML5 UP Edited by Enkhtushig Namkhai

README from original template:

This is Big Picture, a simple, single page responsive site template by HTML5 UP.

So I've been on a single page kick as of late, partly because I'm lazy, but
mostly because they kick ass for experimentation. In this case, Big Picture
makes heavy use of my (tentatively named and soon to be released) "scrollgress"
and "scrollwatch" jQuery plugins to pull off some interesting effects as you
scroll around the page. In addition to said interesting effects, Big Picture
also includes a nice lightbox-style gallery, styling for basic page elements,
and thoroughly commented code for your editing pleasure (with instructions!
-- see below).
