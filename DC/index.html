						<h1>My Travels at Washington DC</h1>
						<p> During my senior year of high school, I decided to go to Washington DC to watch the 2013 inaguration. Me and my friends decided to fundraise for our trip and thanks to the help of our two wonderful teachers and the support of our parents, we were able to raise enough money to go. Only 3 students from my high school went to Washington DC along with one teacher and it was one of the most memorable events that I had been to. We went to all the Smithsonian Museums, the Jeffersonian Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the Pentagon, the Arlington cemetery, the Ford’s theater, and etc. </p>
